# Results

Here is example code for a table with a caption.

```{r table1, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
cars %>% head %>% kable(caption = "Preview of the `cars` dataset.")
```

Here is example code for a figure with a caption.

```{r plot1, fig.cap="Plot of the `cars` dataset", echo=FALSE}
ggplot(cars, aes(x = dist, y = speed)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
